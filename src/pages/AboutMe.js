        I am a person with a methodical, decisive approach and a great curiosity to face challenges efficiently. From a personal point of view, I consider myself open and extroverted. My professional career in the sports and social fields led me to enthusiastically co-found my own Association. For two years, we led various activities in collaboration with schools. During that time, we learned what teamwork is, we managed each event as a project and we effectively solved each problem.

       In addition to my formal training in Java, Spring, Maven, Node, HTML5, CSS3, JS, Git, React, Angular, and Docker, I am always looking to expand my knowledge with technologies like Python, Kotlin, TypeScript, and cybersecurity. This mindset helps me face challenges with flexibility and versatility.
