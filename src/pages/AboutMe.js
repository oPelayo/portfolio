      <h1>AboutMe</h1>
      <p>I am a person with a methodical, decisive approach and a great curiosity to face challenges efficiently.
        From a personal point of view, I consider myself open and extroverted. My professional career in the sports and social fields 
        led me to enthusiastically co-found my own Association. For two years, we led various activities in collaboration 
        with schools. During that time, we learned what teamwork is, we managed each event as a project and 
        we effectively solved each problem.
        These experiences were very enriching and the process of developing our own website sparked my interest in 
        code. Always focused on hardware, I began to delve into software from then on.
        At the moment, I am focusing what I have learned towards this area, exploring different aspects of computing 
        in order to grow professionally.
        In addition to my formal training in Java, Spring, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, JS, Git, Maven and React, 
        I am constantly looking to stay up to date with complementary technologies such as Docker, Kotlin, Python 
        or TypeScript. This approach allows me to face any challenge with greater ease and versatility.
        I am excited about the new goal I have set for myself and I enjoy learning something new every day. 
        I am always open to opportunities and collaborations that allow me to continue growing professionally.</p>
