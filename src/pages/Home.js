      <p>I am a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in Java, Spring, Node.js, Angular and React.
         My experience co-founding an association has provided me with strong skills in project management, 
         teamwork, and problem-solving, which I now apply to build innovative web solutions. 
         My passion for technology drives me to always stay up to date with the latest trends, 
         such as Docker, Kotlin, and TypeScript. I am looking for a challenging environment where 
         I can apply my knowledge and contribute to the development of high-quality products.</p>
